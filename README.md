# Damn Vulnerable Vibe Code App (DVVCA)

## Introduction

The Damn Vulnerable Vibe Code App (DVVCA) is a web application entirely generated by the AI engine **manus.ai** and maintained with codex, with **zero human intervention**. It has been designed to showcase a variety of security vulnerabilities—both intentionally injected by manus.ai and reflective of typical issues found in AI-produced code through the “Vibe Coding” process. DVVCA’s purpose is purely educational: to help security professionals, students, and developers learn how to identify, analyze, and exploit common web application flaws in a controlled environment.

**Disclaimer:** DVVCA is intentionally insecure and was created without any human editing or review. It should **NEVER** be deployed in a production environment or on any internet-facing server. This project exists solely for research and training.

## Key Features

* **Completely AI-Generated:** The entire codebase, including configuration and database scripts, was produced by manus.ai to simulate an automated development workflow.
* **Intentional Vulnerabilities:** Includes a wide range of common web application flaws, deliberately embedded to replicate both classic security errors and AI-specific coding anomalies.
* **Vibe Coding Artifacts:** Demonstrates pitfalls of “Vibe Coding,” where AI-generated code can introduce inconsistencies, missing validations, insecure patterns, and unconventional logic.
* **User Roles:** Simulates admin and regular user roles to mirror real-world access control scenarios.
* **AI-Populated Database:** Ships with a manus.ai-generated SQLite database (`dvvca.db`) preloaded with sample products and user accounts for immediate testing.
* **Flask Framework:** Built using Flask (Python) for straightforward exploration and modification of the code.

## Getting Started: Running DVVCA Locally

Follow these steps to launch DVVCA on your local machine (Windows, macOS, or Linux). A virtual environment is highly recommended to isolate dependencies.

### Prerequisites:

* **Python:** Version 3.11 or higher.
* **pip:** Python package installer.
* **(Linux - Debian/Ubuntu):** `python3-venv` may be required: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-venv`

### Setup and Execution:

1. **Download and Extract:**

   * Obtain the latest DVVCA ZIP (e.g., `dvvca.zip`).
   * Extract the contents; ensure `dvvca.db` resides in the main `dvvca` directory.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/extracted/dvvca
   ```

3. **Create & Activate Virtual Environment:**

   * **Windows:**

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
     ```
   * **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**

   * **Windows:**

     ```bash
     set FLASK_APP=src\\main.py
     python -m flask run
     ```
   * **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     export FLASK_APP=src/main.py
     python3 -m flask run
     ```

6. **Access the App:**
   Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (default).

7. **Stop & Deactivate:**

   * Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.
   * Run `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment.

## Sample User Accounts (In `dvvca.db`)

* **Administrators:**

  * `admin` / `password`
  * `admin2` / `admin123`
* **Regular Users:**

  * `user1` / `password123`
  * `user2` / `123456`
  * `testuser` / `password123`
